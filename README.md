# WebSalesmanAnalysis
The Web Salesman Analysis is a PHP tool that allow enterprises to test employees' skills. Once the employee records his voice and answers the question that is shown on the screen, a specialized Octave code runs in the background and gives him a table of results based on some criteria.

It is fundamental to understand that this is not a final product, but a demonstration that good mathematical tools can aid enterprises to build powerful data analysis that go beyond big data. A lot of tools can be attached to this software to make analysis even more accurate.
